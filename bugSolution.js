// Ensure Tailwind directives are correctly placed in your CSS file or configuration.
// Check for conflicting CSS rules that might override Tailwind classes.
// Verify the Tailwind configuration is correct.
// Ensure that Tailwind is properly initialized within your project.
// If using a framework or build tool like Next.js or Vite, confirm the correct setup.

// Example of a potential solution (depending on the cause):
//  Make sure your Tailwind CSS is imported correctly and the base styles are included in the proper order.
// !tailwind directives should be present and correct.

//Example using a CSS file
/* input.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
